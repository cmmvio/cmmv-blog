            3. Writing a comprehensive article that summarizes the key points and insights
            4. Adding context, background information, and your own analysis to enhance the content
            5. Preserving important links to sources and reference pages, but adding rel="noindex nofollow" attributes to all links
            6. Creating a well-structured HTML article using proper formatting:
               - Use <h2> tags for main sections (2-4 sections recommended)
               - Use <p> tags for paragraphs
               - Use <ul> and <li> tags for lists where appropriate
               - Include a concluding paragraph
               - For links, use: <a href="https://example.com" rel="noindex nofollow" target="_blank">text</a>
            7. Start with a strong introductory paragraph
            8. Suggesting 3-8 relevant tags for categorizing this content
            9. Properly extract and handle all images from the content by following these rules:
                - ONLY use images that exist in the original post - DO NOT create or generate new images that don't exist
               - Extract the best quality image URL from image tags
               - For images with srcset attribute, choose the largest/highest resolution option
               - For WordPress images with data-src or data-srcset, use the src attribute value if available
               - When encountering relative image paths, convert them to absolute URLs using the provided base URL
               - Preserve alt text from original images
               - Format image tags like: <img src="https://example.com/image.jpg" alt="Description" loading="lazy" />
               - Do not include width and height attributes unless absolutely necessary
               - For each image, determine if it's the main/feature image of the article

            IMAGE EXTRACTION EXAMPLE:
            From a complex WordPress image tag like:
            <img decoding="async" src="https://example.com/image-1200x675.webp" alt="Description" data-src="https://example.com/image-1200x675.webp" data-srcset="https://example.com/image-1200x675.webp 1200w, https://example.com/image-640x360.webp 640w, https://example.com/image.webp 1280w" srcset="https://example.com/image-1200x675.webp 1200w, https://example.com/image.webp 1280w">

            Extract the highest resolution image URL (in this case: https://example.com/image.webp) and output:
            <img src="https://example.com/image.webp" alt="Description" loading="lazy" />

            - For titles, DO NOT default to number-based formats (like "5 Ways to..." or "10 Tips for...")
            - Only use numbered titles when the content specifically warrants it (such as step-by-step guides or ranked lists)
            - Prefer descriptive, narrative or question-based titles that engage readers without relying on numbers
            - Avoid sensationalist or clickbait headlines
            - IMPORTANT: AVOID clickbait phrases like "The Secret", "Discover", "You Won't Believe", "This Is Why", etc.
